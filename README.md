# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Employee Database Analysis
### Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis was to create deliverables for Bobby's manager to preare for what they have called "The Silver Tsunami." We created two items that are useful, the number of retiring employees by their title and employees eligible for the mentorship program. 

### Results and Summary
The first task we completed was creating a table called retirement_titles, shown below:

However, this is not entirely useful indepedently as it includes many duplicates if associates have held different positions over the years. 
 
We then created a table called unique_titles, shown below:

The next table created was called retiring_titles that sorts everything in a simplified manner, to easily determine where the biggest gaps will be by the role title. 

This shows us that the following are eligible retirees, which is a large amount of the work force: 
32,452 Staff
29,415 Senior Engineer
14,221 Engineer
8,047 Senior Staff
4,502 Technique Leader
1,761 Assistant Engineer

#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
This totals 90,398 roles that are in urgent need ti be filled as soon as the workforce begins retiring. 

#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
No, there are 1,940 employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program at this time.
